# The_Truth_Is_Out_There_Challenge

The purpose of this analysis is to provide users more flexibility on their ufo searches, all looking at different criteria.  When people search for UFOs they want to search by area, shape, and the description to see if they found something similar to what they saw.  All the user had to do is type in whatever that they are searching for, hit enter, and the results will show up in the table.

So for instance, let's just say someone saw an ufo that looked like a disk and wanted to see if there were similar sightings.  What they would have to do is go to the shape field, type in "disk" and then read the results and look at the data in the table on the webpage.

It's a major improvement from the previous site, as you could only search by the date and city. Now the user could search anything.  However, the only drawback and limitation it has is that people have to type things in precisely.  You have to type everything in lowercase and if you try to use capital letters, it will actually yield you with zero results. I feel like the best way to fix this issue is if one would implement a system where it will search the keywords without matching the case.  Or it will also just search for similar matches/similar results so that way the user can find exactly what they're looking for.
